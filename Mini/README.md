Project title - Incremental Dimensionality Reduction for Global Feature Set Extraction

NHRR data set is a dataset of handwritten digits generated by our own 

Folders Last_0 till Last_9 contains Images taken by us ie the images of NHRR Dataset , these are the processed images

Folders MNIST_0 till MNIST_9 contains images of MNIST Dataset

End Sem PPT.pdf  and End Sem Report.pdf contain PPT and Report

There are various codes but the important ones are as follows - 


Feature Extraction codes -

1 Run length plus scan line - diagonal_feature.py
2 Zone based - Zone_based_extraction.py
3 Scan line - Feature_extraction.py



One class SVM -

All_digits_SVM.py contains Our implementation of OCSVM ,we implemented the algorithm given by Tax and Duin called SVDD



PCA and OCSVM - 

PCA_on_digits contains the code for OCSVM after applying PCA


Incremental Double PCA with PCC and then OCSVM -

incremental_double_pca_pcc.py
